# Fibonacci Counter App

Welcome to the Fibonacci Counter App!
You can check it out [here](https://scality-challenge-l2lke8nyo-jeanmmillet.vercel.app/ target="\_blank")

## Exercise Overview

Your mission is to craft a React application featuring a counter with an increment button. The application should meet the following requirements:

1. **Fibonacci Suite Indicator**: Display a clear signal next to the counter if its current value aligns with a Fibonacci sequence number.
2. **Threshold Alerts**: As the counter approaches a predefined threshold, trigger a user-friendly alert to notify the user about its proximity to a higher value.
3. **Threshold Lock**: Upon crossing a secondary threshold, prevent further counter increments. Provide a user-friendly explanation for this limitation.

**Bonus Challenge**: Design your solution with user experience at the forefront. Consider your solution with adaptability in mind, allowing for easy adjustments to the threshold criteria in the future.

## Technologies Used

- Settings of the 2 thresholds

## Possible improvements

Features that I wanted to do but didn't have time to
